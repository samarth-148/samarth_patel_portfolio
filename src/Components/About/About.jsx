            ðŸ‘‹ Hi there ! I'm Samarth patel. As a Full Stack Developer, I
            specialize in designing dynamic and responsive web apps that make a
            lasting impression. With a good understanding of modern frontend
            technologies such as React.js, I successfully manage state with
            Redux and Recoil, ensuring smooth data flow. My backend expertise in
            Node.js and Express.js enables me to smoothly combine robust
            functionality and elegant design. I pay close attention to detail
            and create interesting user interfaces with HTML, CSS, and
            JavaScript. I prioritize performance and security when maintaining
            databases using MySQL, MongoDB, and PostgreSQL, as well as providing
            secure authentication with JWT. Passionate in system design, agile
            approaches, and continuous improvement, I thrive in collaborative
            contexts and strive for perfection. Let's work together to build
            something extraordinary.
